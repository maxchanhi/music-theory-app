During my undergraduate studies, I took up the bassoon as my second instrument, flute was my major instrument, that is quite important. After graduating from HKBU, I pursued a Master of Composition degree at the Royal Birmingham Conservatoire. I also taught myself Python so I can hop on the AI hype train. I am now back in Hong Kong, developing an app while start learning the clarinet.")
